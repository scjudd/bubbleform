# bubbleform

Process Scantronâ„¢-like (bubble-filling) forms.

At the moment, forms are scanned to PDFs and the individual pages are extracted
with `pdftoppm`. This program operates on `PPM` files.

This is under development. Don't base any work off the `dev` branch unless
you've coordinated it with me, as I'll probably be doing a lot of forced
pushes. Once I push to `master` or change the preceding message, go crazy.
